/**
 *
 *      An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which has been
 *      made a sub-surface. A sub-surface has one parent surface. A
 *      sub-surface's size and position are not limited to that of the parent.
 *      Particularly, a sub-surface is not automatically clipped to its
 *      parent's area.
 *
 *      A sub-surface becomes mapped, when a non-NULL wl_buffer is applied
 *      and the parent surface is mapped. The order of which one happens
 *      first is irrelevant. A sub-surface is hidden if the parent becomes
 *      hidden, or if a NULL wl_buffer is applied. These rules apply
 *      recursively through the tree of surfaces.
 *
 *      The behaviour of a wl_surface.commit request on a sub-surface
 *      depends on the sub-surface's mode. The possible modes are
 *      synchronized and desynchronized, see methods
 *      wl_subsurface.set_sync and wl_subsurface.set_desync. Synchronized
 *      mode caches the wl_surface state to be applied when the parent's
 *      state gets applied, and desynchronized mode applies the pending
 *      wl_surface state directly. A sub-surface is initially in the
 *      synchronized mode.
 *
 *      Sub-surfaces have also other kind of state, which is managed by
 *      wl_subsurface requests, as opposed to wl_surface requests. This
 *      state includes the sub-surface position relative to the parent
 *      surface (wl_subsurface.set_position), and the stacking order of
 *      the parent and its sub-surfaces (wl_subsurface.place_above and
 *      .place_below). This state is applied when the parent surface's
 *      wl_surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-surface's mode.
 *      As the exception, set_sync and set_desync are effective immediately.
 *
 *      The main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,
 *      since it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.
 *
 *      Even if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as
 *      in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in
 *      synchronized mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the
 *      tree of surfaces. This means, that one can set a sub-surface into
 *      synchronized mode, and then assume that all its child and grand-child
 *      sub-surfaces are synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.
 *
 *      If the wl_surface associated with the wl_subsurface is destroyed, the
 *      wl_subsurface object becomes inert. Note, that destroying either object
 *      takes effect immediately. If you need to synchronize the removal
 *      of a sub-surface to the parent surface update, unmap the sub-surface
 *      first by attaching a NULL wl_buffer, update parent, and then destroy
 *      the sub-surface.
 *
 *      If the parent wl_surface object is destroyed, the sub-surface is
 *      unmapped.
