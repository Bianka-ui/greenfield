    <interface name="GrClientSession" version="1">
        <description>
            A global singleton. Functions as a general communication mechanism between a native shim compositor and a
            browser implemented compositor.

        <event name="mark_flush" since="1">
            <description>
                Marks the remote client to be flushed. This call should be made for each bound client and ensures
                all data for this client is send when doing a local flush. After the actual local flush is performed
                the mark flag should be removed.

        <request name="client" since="1">
            <description>
                Request a new client session. The remote browser compositor is expected to
                initiate a new websocket connection as a response. This enables the local server to use the newly
                established websocket connection for client to browser compositor communication.

        <event name="flush" since="1">
            <description>
                Notifies the shim compositor that it expects a flush to happen for all currently connected client
                connections. The actual local flush should only happen if all clients' mark_flush flag has been set.
